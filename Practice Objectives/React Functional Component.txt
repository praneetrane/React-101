// Objectives:React Functional Component
 1. Set up the basic React code from scratch
 2. Create a functional component called MyInfo that returns the following UI:
     a. An h1 with your name
     b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself
     c. An ordered or unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit
 3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser
 Extra challenge: learn on your own (Google!) how you can add some style to your page.
 (We will also cover this in an upcoming lesson).
